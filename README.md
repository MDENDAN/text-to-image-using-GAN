# Text-to-Image-Synthesis 

## Intoduction

This is a pytorch implementation of [Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396), we train a conditional generative adversarial network, conditioned on text descriptions, to generate images that correspond to the description. The network architecture is shown below (Image from [1]). This architecture is based on DCGAN.
